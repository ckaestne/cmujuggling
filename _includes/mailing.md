The [mailing list](https://lists.andrew.cmu.edu/mailman/listinfo/juggling-members) is our main mechanism for announcing meeting times and places and other juggling-related events. You can see recent messages in the [mailing list archive](https://www.mail-archive.com/juggling-members@lists.andrew.cmu.edu/). We have a [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/groups/10387203602/) too, though we more actively use the mailing list.
