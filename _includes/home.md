### Festival: Nov 1-3, 2019

For the third year in a row, we will host the [FluggleBurgh](festival/) juggling festival. It will be Nov 1-3, 2019 in Pittsburgh.

### Juggle With Us!

We meet twice a week on the CMU campus:

 - **Sundays at 3 PM**, Newell-Simon Hall Atrium
 - **Wednesdays at 5 PM**, Roberts Engineering Hall SeaGate Atrium

During warm weather, these meetings will be outside on the cut. If you're driving, CMU's east campus parking garage is free after 5 PM on weekdays and all day Sunday.
