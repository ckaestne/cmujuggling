### Juggling Festival Nov 1-3 2019

For the third year in a row, we will host the FluggleBurgh juggling festival. This year it will be Nov 1-3 2019
in Pittsburgh. For details see [FluggleBurgh](festival/)

### Juggle With Us!

We are the juggling club of the **Carnegie Mellon University** in **Pittsburgh**, open to students and nonstudents. Whether you already know how to juggle or want to learn, just come and join us and have some fun.

We meet twice a week on the CMU campus. In the Spring of 2019 we are meeting on most 
**Sundays at 3pm** and pretty much every **Wednesday at 5pm**. On Sundays we usually meet on Schenley Plaza outside of the Carnegie Library with a group of slackliners and acroyoga folks, on Thursdays we meet on the grass outside of Purnell on campus. If the weather is bad (so most weeks in the spring), we meet in the atrium of Newell-Simon Hall or another room that we announce on our [mailing list](https://lists.andrew.cmu.edu/mailman/listinfo/juggling-members). 
If you're driving, CMU's east campus parking garage is free after 5pm on weekdays and all day Sunday.
