### Juggle With Us!

**The juggling club is taking a break until meetings are safer again. Watch our mailing list for updates. Also our [FluggleBurgh](festival/) festival will take a break and will hopefully be back late 2021.**

During normal times, we meet twice a week on the CMU campus:

 - **Sundays at 3 PM**, Schenley Plaza or Newell-Simon Hall Atrium
 - **Wednesdays at 5 PM**, Outside on the Cut or Roberts Engineering Hall Atrium

See mailing list for short term announcements, location changes, extra dates, or cancelations.
During warm weather, meetings are usually outside on the cut or on Schenley Plaza. If you're driving, parking on campus is free after 5 PM on weekdays in most places (including the East Campus Garage) as well as all day Sunday.
