### About Us

The Masters of Flying Objects is a juggling club at Carnegie Mellon University. It is open to all members of the Carnegie Mellon community as well as anyone in the greater Pittsburgh area. We welcome people of all levels of ability, and we are happy to teach people with no prior juggling experience. We meet frequently, usually twice a week during the school year, so check the mailing list (or the news section of this site) to find our next meeting date and location. If you have any questions about the club, don't hesitate to contact us - preferably over the mailing list or on Facebook, or via juggle@andrew.cmu.edu (not checked as often).

The purpose of the Masters of Flying Objects is to provide and foster an environment for those interested in the art of juggling in which they can meet, share and develop talents, teach skills, and share equipment. The club will promote and teach the art of juggling, contribute to the available recreational activities on campus, represent Carnegie Mellon University in the greater juggling community, and provide juggling-related opportunities to the campus and local community.
