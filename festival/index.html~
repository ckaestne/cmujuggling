<h3>About</h3>
      
      <p><strong>FluggleBurgh</strong> is a 3-day festival for all circus and skill arts hosted by 
      Pittsburghs juggling, acro, and flow arts community (fluggle = flow + juggle). It will be held at the Winchester Thurston School in the heart of Pittsbugh (last year's show space) with the show on the nearby CMU campus. FluggleBurgh will provide a communal practice space with tall ceilings, classrooms with scheduled workshops all weekend, outdoor practice and fire space (weather permitting), object manipulation games/competition, and shows. All walks of object manipulation, circus arts, and movement arts are welcome. </p>


      <p>In spirit, it is a successor of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_janE-erfKc">Not Quite Pittsburgh Juggling Festival</a> (2008-2015). For the first time, the festival is actually within the Pittsburgh city limits.</p>

      <p>Our big goal of this festival is to bring the various communities around circus arts and other skills from Pittsburgh and beyond together, share workshops, and showcase the various skills in a show. We expect plenty of juggling, acrobatics, and flow workshops, as well as some clowning, balloons, and maybe even magic and unicycling.</p>

      <h3>Program (subject to change)</h3>
